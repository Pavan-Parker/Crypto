# Crypto

### P1 is sample node .... P2 P3 are just copies of P1 with just different ports, So please refer P1 and try



EACH NODE HAS DEDICATED PORT (except Pn)
here 10001 10002 10003

1)So,Pn sends using TCP to all ports (DONE and WORKING)

2)P1 recvs msg and generates it hash (DONE and WORKING)
  and shares its hash TO ALL NODES AT ONE. (DONE something and NOT WORKING) --- check shareMyHash() in P1

#### The above step requires Multicast


#### THIS MULTICASTING CODE IS COMPLEX AS FUCK AND I COULDN'T GET ONE WORKING
#### FURTHUR, EVEN IF MULTICAST WORKS, WHEN ONE NODE IS MULTICASTING OTHER NODES SHOULDN'T. (SYNC PROBLEM)


#### AN ALTERNATIVE FOR ABOVE STEP IS IT SENDS TO ALL NODES ONE BY ONE
#### IT'S WON'T BE PROPER THIS WAY, IT'S NOT HOW IT SHOULD WORK
#### FOR EXAMPLE, IN CASE OF BLOCKCHAIN, ALL NODES WILL MULTICAST THEIR VALUES NOT ONE-BY-ONE.

3)Verify hash and print respective msg. (WILL BE DONE EASILY and WILL BE WORKING)
